# Motion Detection Application

## Overview
This Python application uses OpenCV, Pygame, and Tkinter to implement a simple motion detection system using your computer's webcam. When motion is detected, a sound is played.

## Features
- Start and stop motion detection with a button click.
- Press 'Q' to stop and exit the application.
- Visual representation of motion detection in the OpenCV window.
- Sound alert when motion is detected.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Pygame (`pygame`)
- Tkinter (`tk`)

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Adjust the file path in the script to the correct location of your sound file (`beep.mp3`).
3. Run the script.
4. Click the "Start" button in the Tkinter GUI to begin motion detection.
5. Press 'Q' to stop and exit the application.

## File Structure
- `motion_detection.py`: The main Python script.
- `beep.mp3`: Sound file for motion detection alert.

## Additional Notes
- This application is a basic example and may require adjustments for specific use cases.
- Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
- The motion detection algorithm can be customized based on your requirements.
